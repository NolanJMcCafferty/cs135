Paging Overview
----------------
* Choose how many items you want to display on a page.  $itemsPerPage=15;
* Find out how many items there are total. If the data is stored in a DB, then just do this...

    SELECT COUNT(CountryCode) as count from countries;

* Figure how how many pages there are.  

    if ($count > $itemsPerPage)
            $pages = ceil( $count / $itemsPerPage );
    else
            $pages = 1;
